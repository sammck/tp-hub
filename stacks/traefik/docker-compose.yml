# docker-compose.yml configuration for a Traefik reverse-proxy with dashboard.
#
#  Environment Variables:
#    TRAEFIK_VERSION         The version of traefik to use. defaults to 2.10.4

#    SHARED_APP_HOST_RULE
#                            The "Host" Traefik rule expression that will match all HTTP(S) hostnames for the shared public

#    SHARED_LAN_APP_DNS_NAME 
#                            The fully qualified public DNS domain that the private-only shared apps will run on.

#                                 apps.
#    SHARED_LAN_APP_HTTPS_HOST_RULE
#                            The "Host" Traefik rule expression that will match all HTTPS hostnames for the private LAN-only

# Entrypoints:
#    This stack creates a Traefik reverse-proxy with 5 entrypoints:
#
#    Entrypoint      Port   Description
#    ----------      ----   ---------------------------------
#    websecure       7082   Public https:// and http:// entrypoint proxied by cloudflare (SSL already terminated)
#                             X-Forwarded-For and X-Forwarded-Proto headers will be filled in to describe originating
#                             request.
#    lanweb            80   Serves HTTP requests for LAN-local clients
#    lanwebsecure     443   Serves HTTPS requests for LAN-local clients. Self-signed certificate.
#    landashboard    8080   Serves the traefik dashboard on LAN-local http://<any-hostname>:8080.  Requires HTTP basic authentication.
#    portainerui     9000   Serves the Portainer UI on LAN-local http://<any-hostname>:9000.  Requires Portainer integrated authentication.
#
# Externally, this stack serves:
#    http://${TRAEFIK_DNS_NAME}                      Traefik Dashboard (private LAN only)
#    http://<any-host-name>:8080                     Traefik Dashboard (private LAN only)
#    https://${TRAEFIK_DNS_NAME}                     Traefik Dashboard (private LAN only)
#    http(s)://${SHARED_APP_DNS_NAME}                Shared app (public internet and private LAN).  Redirects to ${SHARED_APP_DEFAULT_PATH}
#    http://${SHARED_LAN_APP_DNS_NAME}               Shared app (private LAN only).  Redirects to ${SHARED_LAN_APP_DEFAULT_PATH}
#
#
# Prerequisites:
#   Prerequisites common to all stacks (only done once when traefik is initially set up):
#     * A ${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN} has been created, and NS records are pointing at a nameserver managed by cloudflare.
#     * A cloudflared tunnel has been created, configured and started on this hub host to forward all HTTP and HTTPS
#       requests on "*.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}" to http://localhost:7082 on this host.
#     * A wildcard DNS entry for "*.${PARENT_DNS_DOMAIN}" has been created on cloudflare DNS to proxy all requests to the tunnel
#       mentioned above.
#     * A persistent docker network "traefik" has been created before launching. This network is used by traefik to proxy requests to
#       backend service containers
services:
  traefik:
    # The traefik reverse-proxy (including dashboard).
    #
    #  Configured to:
    #
    #    Use docker network "traefik" for backend connections to services behind the reverse-proxy
    #    Use lets-encrypt to automatically issue and renew SSL certificates. Persistence of lets-encrypt
    #      certificate state is kept in docker volume "traefik_acme", which should never be deleted.
    #    Serve public http(s):// on port 7082 (entrypoint "web").  This is proxied traffic from cloudflare tunnel.
    #    Serve private (internal LAN only) http:// on port 80 (entrypoint "lanweb"). This port should NOT be exposed to the internet 
    #    Serve private (internal LAN only) https:// on port 443 (entrypoint "lansecureweb"). A self-signed certificate
    #      is used (not a valid certificate). This port should NOT be exposed to the internet.
    #    Serve a password-authenticated Traefik dashboard on http://${TRAEFIK_DNS_NAME}, https://${TRAEFIK_DNS_NAME},
    #      and "http://<any-hostname>:8080", all for internal LAN only.
