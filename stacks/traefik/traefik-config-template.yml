# Interpolated template for Traefik YAML config file.
#
# This file contains environment variable interpolations that are expanded into
# traefik-config.yml by `hub build`, in a manner similar to the way docker-compose
# expands environment variables in docker-compose.yml.
#
# Changes to traefik configuration should be made in this file, then expanded with `hub build`
